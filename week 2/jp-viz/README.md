This chart compares the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) with a new group of upstarts, MIST (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey). The data are from the World Bank. It was my attempt to achieve object constancy for multiple sets of time series data. I used d3.nest() to sort one big CSV file based on each economic indicator, then used d3.key() on the header row (the countries) to make ensure constancy. Check the boxes at the top to highlight the country groups. An interpretation of this visual can be found [on my website](http://theoldbeggar.com/posts/brics-mist/).
