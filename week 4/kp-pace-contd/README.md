# Continuing the pace viz

The first thing I did this week was clean up the dataset to include dates!

My csv export last week didn't have dates. To get that info, I literally copied and pasted plain text from the Garmin site and edited that ugly data into a pretty csv. See the `pace.txt` for the original file, the `format-csv.py` for a command line python script I ran to output `pretty-pace.csv` -- a workable csv with all the info I want.
