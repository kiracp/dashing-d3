About this visualization...
-----
This visualization is inspired by habit tracking in bullet journals, and pulls values from a csv with dates and habit values.

Repurposing code from [Day/Hour Heatmap] (http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084) which is inspired by [Trulia Trends](http://trends.truliablog.com/2011/09/house-hunter-by-day-not-so-much-after-midnight/) - but with code and using SVG.

Updated that example to pull data from a csv formatted in separate columns



Improvements I've made
-----
-Fix the date/time format on the y axis
-Fix the x axis formating
-Reformat the legend

Things I would do next
-----
-Comment the axis drawing
-Attempt to redraw axes and rectangles more gracefully
-Add tooltips
-Rename variables
